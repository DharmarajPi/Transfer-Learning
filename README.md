# Image Classsification using Transfer-Learning VGG16


**Introduction**


I have implemented the image classification using the VGG-16 Deep Convolutional Network used as a Transfer Learning framework. For the experiment,I used the Fruits dataset and classify the image objects into 3 classes ( Apple, Banana, Orange ).


**What Is Transfer Learning?**


Transfer learning generally refers to a process where a model trained on one problem is used in some way on a second related problem. For example, the knowledge gained while learning to recognize oranges could apply when trying to recognize mangos. In deep learning, transfer learning is a technique whereby a neural network model is first trained on a problem similar to the problem that is being solved. Transfer learning has the advantage of decreasing the training time for a learning model and can result in lower generalization error.

**VGG16**


VGG-16 is a convolutional neural network that is 16 layers deep. You can load a pre-trained version of the network trained on more than a million images from the ImageNet database. The pre-trained network can classify images into 1000 object categories, such as keyboard, mouse, pencil, and many animals. As a result, the network has learned rich feature representations for a wide range of images. The network has an image input size of 224-by-224.
